A circular, dark orange and brown image resembling a cross-section of a tubular structure is displayed. Two lines, one teal and one yellow-green, intersect within the circle, marked with small dots along their paths. Below this main image are two smaller rectangular sections. The lower section features a horizontal band of the same orange-brown pattern as the circle above, marked with a numbered scale and grid lines. The scale on the lower image runs from 0 to 40 millimeters. A "1 mm" label with a corresponding square grid is placed near the lower right of the main circular image, indicating scale.

The yellow-green line within the circular image begins to move clockwise around the center, and the bottom horizontal image band scrolls to the left, corresponding to the movement of the yellow-green line. The teal line remains static, providing a fixed reference point across the image. The movement of the yellow-green line and the scrolling of the bottom band represent the dynamic examination of the tubular structure.

The yellow-green line continues its clockwise rotation, and the horizontal image below scrolls synchronously. The teal line remains stationary, offering a consistent reference as the structure is examined. As the yellow-green line rotates, the pattern within the circular cross-section changes, revealing varying textures and densities within the tubular structure. These variations are mirrored in the horizontal band, which scrolls to display a longitudinal view of the structure in sync with the rotation.
