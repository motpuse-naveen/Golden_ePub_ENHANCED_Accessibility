            <div class="textfl" id="p5001">The shapes of mammalian cells vary widely depending on their interactions
               with each other, their extracellular environment and internal structures. Their surfaces are often
               highly folded when absorptive or transport functions take place across their boundaries. Cell size is
               limited by rates of diffusion, either that of material entering or leaving cells, or that of diffusion
               within them. Movement of macromolecules can be much accelerated and also directed by processes of
               active transport across the plasma membrane and by transport mechanisms within the cell. According to
               the location of absorptive or transport functions, apical microvilli (<span class="bold">Fig. 1.1</span>) or basolateral infoldings create a large surface area for
               transport or diffusion.</div>

            <div class="text" id="p5002">Motility is a characteristic of most cells, in the form of movements of
               cytoplasm or specific organelles from one part of the cell to another. It also includes: the extension
               of parts of the cell surface such as pseudopodia, lamellipodia, filopodia and microvilli; locomotion
               of entire cells, as in the amoeboid migration of tissue macrophages; the beating of flagella or cilia
               to move the cell (e.g. in spermatozoa) or fluids overlying it (e.g. in respiratory epithelium); cell
               division; and muscle contraction. Cell movements are also involved in the uptake of materials from
               their environment (endocytosis, phagocytosis) and the passage of large molecular complexes out of
               cells (exocytosis, secretion).</div>
