A grayscale, cross-sectional ultrasound image reveals soft tissue structures with a relatively well-circumscribed, rounded mass located centrally. The lesion is hypoechoic, meaning it appears darker than the surrounding tissue, with clearly defined margins. The internal architecture is somewhat heterogeneous, indicating internal complexity or varied tissue composition. A slightly hyperechoic rim, brighter than the mass, surrounds it, suggesting compression of surrounding tissues. The adjacent soft tissue shows a striated pattern and appears mildly compressed, indicating mass effect.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
A well-rounded, ovoid hypoechoic mass gradually becomes visible and enlarges before fading from view. It has few scattered internal low-intensity echoes, suggesting minor internal variation. The lesion is surrounded by a prominent hyperechoic rim, clearly demarcating it from adjacent tissue structures. There is no evidence of posterior acoustic enhancement or shadowing, suggesting a relatively uniform composition. Surrounding hyperechoic streaks likely represent displaced or compressed fascial planes.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
A fusiform hypoechoic lesion appears, aligned along the anatomical course of a peripheral nerve. The mass shows a heterogeneous internal echotexture but remains relatively well-defined. A characteristic “target sign” is visible, a central echogenic (bright) core surrounded by a hypoechoic rim, a pattern typical of benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs) such as schwannomas. The overlying subcutaneous fat and skin layers remain intact. Notably, the lesion is in continuity with the parent nerve, confirming it as intraneural rather than an external compressive lesion.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
A repeated transverse view through the same mass confirms earlier findings. The lesion maintains an eccentric position in relation to the nerve, a distinguishing feature of schwannomas, as opposed to neurofibromas which are centrally located and inseparable from the nerve. The mass retains a fusiform shape, and the surrounding muscle and fascial layers appear normal. There is no evidence of tissue invasion, perilesional edema, or acoustic shadowing. Although Color Doppler imaging is not shown, benign lesions like schwannomas typically exhibit mild internal vascularity.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
An oval, hypoechoic mass with well-demarcated borders and internal heterogeneity reappears, initially in the central field and later slightly to the left. Internally, areas of relative echogenicity may indicate collagenous stroma, while the surrounding more hypoechoic rim likely represents a myxoid or cellular component. The parent nerve is visualized entering and exiting the lesion, an important diagnostic feature of intraneural tumors. There are no signs of necrosis, calcification, or posterior acoustic shadowing. These sonographic features strongly suggest a benign schwannoma, with low suspicion for malignant PNST due to the lesion's clean margins and non-invasive appearance.
