Professor Peter Hindmarsh: An adrenal
crisis is a medical emergency.

00:00:04.398 --> 00:00:06.693
This is recognized by
the emergency services

00:00:06.693 --> 00:00:08.435
who give high
priority to attending

00:00:08.435 --> 00:00:10.646
a person with adrenal insufficiency.

00:00:11.241 --> 00:00:14.647
The key word for
triage after calling this emergency service number

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:18.516
is adrenal insufficiency which
triggers their care pathway.

00:00:19.244 --> 00:00:21.474
Preventing an adrenal
crisis is important,

00:00:21.473 --> 00:00:23.774
as it carries a high
morbidity and mortality.

00:00:23.935 --> 00:00:28.238
So understanding sick day rules and what
to do in situations such as trauma,

00:00:28.238 --> 00:00:31.209
or with diarrhoeal problems is important.

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:35.883
This video
covers some of this, but for more detail,

00:00:35.883 --> 00:00:38.242
please consult our book
Replacement Therapies

00:00:38.242 --> 00:00:41.324
in Adrenal Insufficiency
published by Elsevier.

00:00:41.611 --> 00:00:47.399
This contains a lot of information on
emergency pathways, preparing for surgery,

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.838
and of course, visiting the dentist.

00:00:52.151 --> 00:00:54.863
The cause
of an adrenal crisis is an acute

00:00:54.863 --> 00:00:59.337
deficiency of adrenal hormones,
cortisol and aldosterone.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.718
This is often precipitated by a stress,
such as an infection or trauma.

00:01:05.247 --> 00:01:09.362
This can occur in people already
diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency,

00:01:09.815 --> 00:01:12.690
or as a first presentation of a new case.

00:01:13.565 --> 00:01:19.686
In addition, patients receiving or who have
received high doses of glucocorticoids

00:01:19.686 --> 00:01:22.371
for other conditions are
also at risk

00:01:22.371 --> 00:01:25.036
because their own adrenal
glands are suppressed.

00:01:25.994 --> 00:01:31.981
Key features prompting urgent attention
often known as red flags are confusion,

00:01:31.981 --> 00:01:36.059
seizures and coma along with low blood
pressure.

00:01:37.205 --> 00:01:40.952
The classical
biochemical triad is a low plasma sodium

00:01:40.974 --> 00:01:45.755
and raised plasma potassium
levels along with a low blood glucose.

00:01:47.705 --> 00:01:49.979
This is illustrated in this diagram which shows

00:01:50.004 --> 00:01:51.902
a loss of cortisol on
the left-hand side,

00:01:51.902 --> 00:01:55.029
and aldosterone loss on
the right-hand side.

00:01:55.581 --> 00:01:58.571
Loss of cortisol leads
to a low blood glucose

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.252
or hypoglycemia, and
because of vomiting,

00:02:03.816 --> 00:02:10.486
a reduction in blood volume, which is also
contributed to by the loss of aldosterone.

00:02:10.935 --> 00:02:14.484
Loss of aldosterone leads to sodium
loss in the urine.

00:02:15.368 --> 00:02:21.889
Loss of sodium in this way is associated
with a rise in plasma potassium which can

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:25.974
lead to heart rhythm abnormalities
and cardiac arrest.

00:02:27.561 --> 00:02:31.550
Hydrocortisone needs to be given urgently
intravenously,

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.303
and the doses are shown over here, in the left column.

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:42.153
The plasma sodium is
best rectified initially

00:02:42.153 --> 00:02:46.899
with fluid replacement
and oral fludrocortisone treatment

00:02:46.926 --> 00:02:51.808
can be instituted when the
patient can take medications orally.

00:02:53.116 --> 00:02:55.599
During illness
we employ a stepped approach.

00:02:56.192 --> 00:03:01.308
If there is a raised temperature over 38
degrees but no vomiting,

00:03:01.308 --> 00:03:03.647
then double or triple
doses of hydrocortisone

00:03:03.647 --> 00:03:05.869
are needed, with
an extra double,

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:08.658
the morning dose given at four AM.

00:03:10.787 --> 00:03:14.479
Level two is
when vomiting is present.

00:03:15.302 --> 00:03:18.738
If it is more than an hour
since the last dose was administered,

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.687
that dose will have been absorbed.

00:03:21.358 --> 00:03:26.459
If however, vomiting takes place less than
an hour, then the dose should be repeated.

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:29.558
And if this is vomited
again within an hour

00:03:29.558 --> 00:03:32.423
an intramuscular injection
of hydrocortisone should be given,

00:03:32.448 --> 00:03:36.585
and the patient should be taken
to accident and emergency for assessment.

00:03:37.363 --> 00:03:41.321
If in any doubt, give the intramuscular
injection of hydrocortisone,

00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:43.654
as no harm will come of it.

00:03:46.437 --> 00:03:48.968
More at
four is designed to keep patients safe

00:03:48.968 --> 00:03:50.518
in the early
hours of the morning.

00:03:51.018 --> 00:03:54.292
The dose given is double or triple
the first dose of the morning,

00:03:54.532 --> 00:03:58.450
and is in addition to the double or triple
morning dose.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.875
This extra dose should be given regardless
of doses taken earlier in the night.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.212
The reason
for more at four is that the circadian

00:04:07.212 --> 00:04:10.307
rhythm of cortisol tells
us that cortisol starts

00:04:10.307 --> 00:04:12.164
to rise in the blood
from around midnight

00:04:12.164 --> 00:04:16.720
reaching a peak between six and seven AM.

00:04:19.171 --> 00:04:22.928
Without dosing
schedules for hydrocortisone, replacement

00:04:24.898 --> 00:04:32.280
means that at four AM there is a critical
time when the evening dose has worn off.

00:04:35.087 --> 00:04:39.023
This means that even
doubling or tripling the evening

00:04:39.023 --> 00:04:41.393
dose in illness
will not last long enough

00:04:41.393 --> 00:04:45.673
to cover this time period,
which is when most adrenal crisis occur.

00:04:46.335 --> 00:04:49.125
So extra dosing is needed during illness.

00:04:49.783 --> 00:04:53.716
Incidentally, this graph taken from a
patient with congenital adrenal hyperplasia

00:04:53.925 --> 00:04:57.170
includes 17 hydroxyprogesterone
measurements in purple,

00:04:57.566 --> 00:05:01.531
and you can see nicely the increased drive
from two to three to the adrenal gland

00:05:01.531 --> 00:05:04.604
raising 17 hydroxyprogesterone
from four AM

00:05:04.792 --> 00:05:08.410
due to the absence of
cortisol at this time.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.782
Doubling
the dose does not double

00:05:11.782 --> 00:05:13.382
the amount of cortisol in the blood.

00:05:13.556 --> 00:05:20.936
Even a triple dose in this case
shown in the slide of 30 milligrams

00:05:20.936 --> 00:05:23.455
hardly reaches 1200 nanomoles per litre.

00:05:23.606 --> 00:05:26.511
It's not until a dose of
50 milligrams is given

00:05:26.536 --> 00:05:29.629
that we get double the
cortisol in the blood.

00:05:31.955 --> 00:05:35.446
This is because of the
presence of cortisol binding globulin in the blood.

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:39.385
Cortisol binding globulin
or CBG binds cortisol,

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.913
and the cortisol we measure in the lab
as a measure of this bound cortisol,

00:05:42.913 --> 00:05:45.744
and the cortisol that
is unbound, or free.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.965
CBG binds about 95 percent
of cortisol in the blood,

00:05:49.965 --> 00:05:55.500
but it becomes saturated around a
concentration of 500 nanomoles per litre.

00:05:56.371 --> 00:05:59.569
If cortisol exceeds 500
nanomoles per litre,

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:02.682
then the amount that
is free will increase.

00:06:03.382 --> 00:06:10.692
But because free cortisol is easily removed
by the kidneys and passed out in the urine,

00:06:10.925 --> 00:06:15.264
the actual rise in cortisol is
less than expected.

00:06:16.517 --> 00:06:20.769
However,
doubling or tripling the dose is important

00:06:20.769 --> 00:06:25.582
because when temperature in the body
increases, less cortisol is bound to CBG.

00:06:26.205 --> 00:06:30.530
So for example, in tonsillitis the increase
in temperature locally in the tonsils,

00:06:30.544 --> 00:06:33.873
which means more cortisol
falls of CBG in the tonsils,

00:06:33.873 --> 00:06:36.738
there's a greater local
effect without exposing

00:06:36.738 --> 00:06:39.106
the rest of the body to
high cortisol levels.

00:06:39.796 --> 00:06:43.341
But we need the extra hydrocortisone to
allow for this clever process to take

00:06:43.341 --> 00:06:47.746
place in the tonsils
so double or tripling the dose is needed.

00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:52.885
The key
points from this video are summarized here.

00:06:53.624 --> 00:06:57.084
An adrenal crisis can occur in anyone who
becomes unwell,

00:06:57.348 --> 00:07:00.560
so knowing what to do
when sick is important.

00:07:01.368 --> 00:07:05.343
In level one there is sickness
with a temperature above 38 degrees

00:07:05.343 --> 00:07:09.104
and no vomiting,
double or triple dosing is needed.

00:07:10.037 --> 00:07:14.136
In level two there is sickness
with a temperature above 38 degrees

00:07:14.136 --> 00:07:15.533
and also vomiting.

00:07:16.244 --> 00:07:19.667
If the vomiting takes
place one hour after the

00:07:19.667 --> 00:07:21.812
hydrocortisone dose has
been administered,

00:07:21.812 --> 00:07:26.470
the medication is likely to have been
absorbed and no repeat dose is needed.

00:07:27.495 --> 00:07:31.449
If vomiting occurs within an hour,
then the dose should be repeated.

00:07:32.403 --> 00:07:35.092
If vomiting occurs again
within one hour,

00:07:35.092 --> 00:07:37.774
an intramuscular injection
of hydrocortisone is needed

00:07:38.058 --> 00:07:42.254
and the person should go straight
to accident and emergency for assessment.

00:07:43.617 --> 00:07:50.185
Give an extra double strip or triple
dose around four AM in all situations.

00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:53.602
Double or triple dosing
is needed to maintain

00:07:53.602 --> 00:07:57.007
good delivery of cortisol to
the areas of inflammation.

00:07:58.669 --> 00:08:01.618
We can't cover everything in this
particular video.

00:08:02.005 --> 00:08:08.656
But detailed information on when to double
or triple a dose is available in our book

00:08:08.656 --> 00:08:13.142
Replacement Therapies in Adrenal Insufficiency published by Elsevier.

This includes flow diagrams on how to
handle diarrhoea, dental procedures, burns,

00:08:21.401 --> 00:08:27.553
trauma and other aspects of emergency
care along with dealing with surgery.
